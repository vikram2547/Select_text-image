# Select_text-image
Created a simple code which will let you to select the text or image and run some functions over them.
I have created three div's having a content in them.
firstly we can see the dropdown option below the div where you can select the option text or image if text selected u will get the field to type your text and
if image option selected u will get a option to slect the image from your system.
next u will get a new option to select the div in which you have to do the changes.
After selecting div it will ask to position where you want to add the particular text or image.
and finally after submitting it will give u the result.
Thank you.
